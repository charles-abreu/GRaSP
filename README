VERSION 1.0.0  May 2020.

GRaSP is a residue centric method to predict ligand biding site residues. It is
based on a supervised learning strategy that models the residue environment as a
graph at the atomic level. The program is written in python and should work on
most UNIX like environment.

usage
-----
The program is run by the python script called "grasp.py". To use GRaSP, simply
type "python3 grasp.py", using the parameters -p followed by the name of a valid
PDB file or a directory contaning many PDB valid files, and -o followed by the
name of a output directory to save the results, as shown below

  python3 grasp.py -p proteinFile -o outputDir

                    or

  python3 grasp.py -p proteinDir -o outputDir

By default, GRaSP uses the exposure information calculated by Biopython library
to perform the preditcion. You could use the naccess program to achieve more
accurated results (http://wolf.bms.umist.ac.uk/naccess/). If you want to use it
just type -n followed by the directory name where naccess is, as shown below.

  python3 grasp.py -p proteinFile -o outputDir -n naccessDir

example output files
--------------------
The output is a .csv file containing two columns: the first one (res_name) which
contains the residue information and the second one (prediction) with the class
label predicted. The class label is binary. Class equal to 1 represents positive
(residue biding site) and 0 means negative (not residue biding site). The residue
infomation is composed by pdb Id, chain, residue name and residue number joined by
underlines.
